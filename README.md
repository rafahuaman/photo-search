# Photo Search

Hello! 👋🏽 I'm Rafael Huaman.

This is my submission of the Photo Search exercise.

I approached this exercise as I would a real project so I ensured the application was well-tested and included build and deployment pipelines.

The links below include the project documentation along with Testing Guidelines, an example of the type of guides I like include in my projects to help the team.

I also added an Improvements section to capture things I didn't do but identified as potential improvements.
