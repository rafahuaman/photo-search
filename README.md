# Photo Search

Hello! üëãüèΩ I'm Rafael Huaman.

This is my solution of the [Photo Search exercise](docs/00-exercise-description.md).

I approached this exercise as an actual project, ensuring the application was well-tested and included build and deployment pipelines.

The links below include the project documentation and Testing Guidelines, an example of the guides I like to have in my projects to help the team.

I also added an Improvements section to capture things I didn't do but identified as potential improvements.
